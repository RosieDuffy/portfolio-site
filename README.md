## Overview

This project is a web application aimed at showcasing personal information, skills, projects, and providing a contact form for communication. The application features various animations and interactions to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Hamburger Menu Animation**: The application includes a hamburger menu icon that toggles the display of the navigation menu when clicked.

- **Annotation Animations**: Utilizing the "rough-notation" library, the application adds dynamic annotations to specific elements on the page, such as highlighting, underlining, etc.

- **Scroll Triggered Animations**: Using the ScrollMagic library, animations are triggered when certain elements come into view during scrolling. This adds visual appeal and engages users as they navigate the page.

- **Content Expansion**: Users can expand and collapse content sections with a "Read more/Less" button, providing a streamlined experience for accessing additional information.

- **Contact Form Validation and Submission**: The application features a contact form with client-side validation for required fields. Upon successful validation, the form data is submitted via email using the Email.js library.
